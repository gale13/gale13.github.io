## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I received my B.E. (2020) and Ph.D. (2025) in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). My research interests lie in online generative optimization, spatiotemporal scheduling, and data-driven intelligent urban decision-making.

## Research Interests

- **Online Generative Optimization:** diffusion-based methods for optimization, online learning
- **Spatiotemporal Scheduling:** stochastic optimization, online scheduling, Lyapunov optimization
- **Data-Driven Intelligent Urban Decision-Making:** data mining, human mobility, AI
